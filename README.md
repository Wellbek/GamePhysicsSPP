# Game Physics SPP

This repository showcases a [custom physics engine](https://github.com/Wellbek/customphysics) built in Godot, as part of the RWTH Aachen Game Physics Software Project Lab during summer semester 2023. The project was completed with a 3D tower defense game developed to test and demonstrate the engine's capabilities.

## Repository Structure

- **Final Game/**  
  Contains the full source code and assets for the 3D tower defense game, developed in Godot to leverage and test the custom physics features.

- **Game Physics Assignment Sheet 2/**  
- **Game Physics Assignment Sheet 3/**  
- **Game Physics Assignment Sheet 5/**  
  These folders contain project files for each corresponding assignment, focused on implementing parts of the custom physics engine as outlined in each assignment sheet.

- **Test Cases/**  
  Used for various test scences to verify the physics engineâ€™s accuracy, performance, and stability.

- **Assignment Sheet 2, 3, and 5 (PDFs)**  
  Documentation for each assignment, covering the mandatory tasks required to build and refine the custom physics engine. These assignments were instrumental in developing this engine, with specific requirements and guidelines.

## Project Overview

This project required creating a physics engine by completing mandatory tasks across five assignments. Not all of them required Godot Engine and were therefore excluded from the repository. Each assignment (Sheets 2, 3, and 5) builds on the previous one to implement and optimize core physics functionalities in the Godot engine. The custom physics engine can be found in the following repository:

### Final Game

The final game is a physics-heavy, 3D tower defense game where players face an endless number of waves. It was developed to test the performance, scalability, and stability of the custom physics engine in real-time, high-stress scenarios.

## Video Demonstrations

Here are video links demonstrating the custom physics engine in action, as well as gameplay from the final tower defense game:
